## Contents of this directory
This is the place to store datasheets used for development of hardware drivers in the UHSDR firmware project

## What to add
Please add only files with strong relevance for the firmware, i.e. for peripheral devices with active or finished development.
Please do not add files with not yet supported devices. Create an issue in the GitHub issue tracker, add the document and see if someone wants to develop code to support the device.

## Naming Scheme
To have a somewhat uniform naming scheme, we rename the files from the original documents name to "Datasheet_<devicename>.pdf"
If there are supplementary documents for a device, just add an appendix such as "Datasheet_<devicename>_AppNote.pdf"
