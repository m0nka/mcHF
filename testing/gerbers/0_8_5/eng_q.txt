There is an engineering question about your order W96857ASD53_mcHFPro_ui_0_8_5_19_Nov_2024.
See pic1,the space between these 0.4mm holes is less than 0.35mm,the space is too small to produce.So it will cause short circuit after production.
We suggest to shrink these holes size by 0.05mm for production,is this ok for you?
