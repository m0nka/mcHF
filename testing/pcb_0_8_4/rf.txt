--------------------------------------------
ToDo: Rearange rooms:
[- U3/U4 move somewhere under cells]
[- SMPS go around the encoder - top and bottom layer(away from cells)]
[- bms go to where tx pre-amp is(away from cells)]
[- battery footprint rotated 180deg]
[- under cells - tx pre-amp, pa bias and BPFs]
- under cells - LPF control
[- BPFs - go where SMPS was]
[- BMS mosfets, under PA heatsink]
--------------------------------------------
- heatsink mount holes wrong
- batt holder footprint wrong
- usb footprint wrong
- usb conn sticking out too much
- fan conn top overlay under connector
- encoder poss might be wrong
- fan position holes wrong spacing
- heatsink bolts holes need to be grounded slots, with large contact surfice(to cool PCB as well)
- final mosfets needs to come closer to heatsink
- U6 footprint is rotated
- C77 needs 10uF ceramic
- C29 to 100nF
- U4 maybe touching components on the MIX board
- encoder needs caps(1nF) to GND
- add LEDs on power rails
- put solder mask rectangluars for each LPF(both sides)
- U7 and U8 need large heat pads on top layer only
- C97 text, move
- USB footprint mirrored
- CFG1,2 and 3 need to be NC
- C29 needs discharge resistor
- L28 needs to be bigger inductor
- align relays
- switch to 1S batt holders
- add GND testing hole
- usb pd module need isolation diode(to prevent vbus feedin from batt)
- Q6 and Q7 need large heat pads
- replace batt socket with 5x1S
- move heatsink outwards
- reposition ACC connector
- Q4 and Q5 footprint rotated
- rotate D5(pa), add cap to GND ?
- change SMPS inductors
- pack resistor(R73) reduce to 1k
- short VC5 and VC6, connect to top cell via 100ohm, add cap
- connect all four thermistors to BMS chip
- Fuse pin(BMS) needs to be connected to GND
- D6 needs to be hooked to BAT+ after the fuse!
- feedback from PD chip - hook to where ?
- add 1mm to top and bottom of the board
- verify if new tall comp pos touch UI board
- use relay tx switch
