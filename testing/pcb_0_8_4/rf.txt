- heatsink mount holes wrong
- batt holder footprint wrong
- usb footprint wrong
- usb conn sticking out too much
- fan conn top overlay under connector
- encoder poss might be wrong
- fan position holes wrong spacing
- heatsink bolts need mask and spacing around
- final mosfets needs to come closer to heatsink
- U6 footprint is rotated
- C77 needs 10uF ceramic
- C29 to 100nF
- U4 maybe touching components on the MIX board
- encoder needs caps(1nF) to GND
- add LEDs on power rails
- put solder mask rectangluars for each LPF(both sides)
- U7 and U8 need large heat pads on top layer only
- C97 text, move
- USB footprint mirrored
- CFG1,2 and 3 need to be NC
- C29 needs discharge resistor
- L28 needs to be bigger inductor
