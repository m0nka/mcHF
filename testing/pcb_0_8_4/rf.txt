--------------------------------------------
Rearange rooms:
[- U3/U4 move somewhere under cells]
[- SMPS go around the encoder - top and bottom layer(away from cells)]
[- bms go to where tx pre-amp is(away from cells)]
[- battery footprint rotated 180deg]
[- under cells - tx pre-amp, pa bias and BPFs]
[- under cells - LPF control]
[- BPFs - go where SMPS was]
[- BMS mosfets, under PA heatsink]
--------------------------------------------
BMS changes:
[- pack resistor(R73) reduce to 1k]
[- short VC5 and VC6, connect to top cell via 100ohm, add cap]
[- connect all four thermistors to BMS chip]
[- Fuse pin(BMS) needs to be connected to GND]
[- D6 needs to be hooked to BAT+ after the fuse!]
[- add PWM ch mosfet control]
[- hook BMS_PWM line to the UI board]
- add cooling pads at bottom layer
- Q6 and Q7 need large heat pads
--------------------------------------------
Batt holder:
- batt holder footprint wrong
- replace batt socket with 5x1S, update footprint
- add two thermistors to pack
--------------------------------------------
TX PA:
- heatsink mount holes wrong
- heatsink bolts holes need to be grounded slots, with large 
  contact surfice(to cool PCB as well)
- final mosfets needs to come closer to heatsink
- move heatsink outwards
- Q4 and Q5 footprint rotated
- rotate D5(pa), add cap to GND ?
--------------------------------------------
USB_PD:
[- usb footprint wrong]
[- usb conn sticking out too much] NB: left as it is!
[- USB footprint mirrored]
[- U6 footprint is rotated]
[- C77 needs 10uF ceramic]
[- CFG1,2 and 3 need to be NC]
[- usb pd module need isolation diode]
[- feedback from PD chip - hook to where ?]
--------------------------------------------
- fan conn top overlay under connector
- fan position holes wrong spacing
--------------------------------------------
- encoder poss might be wrong
- encoder needs caps(1nF) to GND
--------------------------------------------

- C29 to 100nF
- U7 and U8 need large heat pads on top layer only
- C97 text, move
- C29 needs discharge resistor
- L28 needs to be bigger inductor
- change SMPS inductors

[- use relay tx switch]
[- add filter on fan power]

- add GND testing hole
- add LEDs on power rails

- add voltage boost module(21V)

- put solder mask rectangluars for each LPF(both sides)
- align relays
- reposition ACC connector
- J9 is under paddles - move or remove

- add 1mm to top and bottom of the board
- U4 maybe touching components on the MIX board
- verify if new tall comp pos touch UI board

- update sch sheets version
