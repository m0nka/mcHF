- S22 and S24 footprint still wrong
- LORA module touches large inductor on RF board
- C21b maybe touches relays on RF board ?
- RFC5/RFC6 needs larger footprint
- CC25 touches final PA transformer
- C19 touches RFC3 on RF board
- C21b touches one of the LPF relays
- move C51 as it prevents rework on the touch conn
- add test points next to J8 connector, bottom layer for all touch signals
- connect PE2(M46) to R19(pin3) together to have BT connection status in firmware
- 'LORA ANT' text in the cutout
- swap M12/M29 (x3 and y1), bad mod, only in next revision(info in keypad_pins.txt)
- swap M33/M28 (x4 and y2)
- add BT power control
