- S22 and S24 footprint still wrong
- LORA module touches large inductor on RF board
- C21b maybe touches relays on RF board ?
- RFC5/RFC6 needs larger footprint
- CC25 touches final PA transformer
- C19 touches RFC3 on RF board
- C21b touches one of the LPF relays
- move C51 as it prevents rework on the touch conn
- add test points next to J8 connector, bottom layer for all touch signals
- 'LORA ANT' text in the cutout
- swap M12/M29 (Y1 and X4), (info in keypad_pins.txt)
- swap M33/M28 (Y2 and X3)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
- [connect PE2(M46) to R19(pin3) together to have BT connection status in firmware]
- [add BT power control]
- [hook LCD vdd to 3V rail, so bootloader mode can keep 5 and 8V off]
- [D6/D7 are likely not needed, as the chip has internal switch(ToDo: investigate)]
- [remove external VREF bandgap, use internal ?(nothing that needs precision, since BMS now does all critical ADC meas)]
- [Maybe rethink the PROG_HOLD line, so we can do development with built in battery as well ?]
- [add zero ohm links on the attenuator data lines]

- increase R38/C39 to have delay in bootloader ?(hold power in hw on reset)

- R38(DNP), to reduce voltage drop on cold power start

- isolate RTC osc crystal with ground plane

- use 2W LORA module(E22-900T33S-V2), add break on the internal antenna line(verify power supply!)
