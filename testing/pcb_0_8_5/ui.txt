- S22 and S24 footprint still wrong
- LORA module touches large inductor on RF board
- C21b maybe touches relays on RF board ?
- RFC5/RFC6 needs larger footprint
- CC25 touches final PA transformer
- C19 touches RFC3 on RF board
- C21b touches one of the LPF relays
- move C51 as it prevents rework on the touch conn
- add test points next to J8 connector, bottom layer for all touch signals
- connect PE2(M46) to R19(pin3) together to have BT connection status in firmware
- 'LORA ANT' text in the cutout
- swap M12/M29 (Y1 and X4), (info in keypad_pins.txt)
- swap M33/M28 (Y2 and X3)
- add BT power control(RFM_DIO2 ?)
- increase R38/C39 to have delay in bootloader ?(hold power in hw on reset)
- add zero ohm links on the attenuator data lines
- Maybe rethink the PROG_HOLD line, so we can do development with built in battery as well ?
- hook LCD vdd to 3V rail, so bootloader mode can keep 5 and 8V off
- dual LCD supply via diodes(3V and 5V rails)
- R38(DNP), to reduce voltage drop on cold power start
- D6/D7 are likely not needed, as the chip has internal switch(ToDo: investigate)
