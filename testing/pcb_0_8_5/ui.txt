- S22 and S24 footprint still wrong
- LORA module touches large inductor on RF board
- C21b maybe touches relays on RF board ?
- RFC5/RFC6 needs larger footprint
- CC25 touches final PA transformer
- C19 touches RFC3 on RF board
- C21b touches one of the LPF relays
- move C51 as it prevents rework on the touch conn
- add test points next to J8 connector, bottom layer for all touch signals
