- BH1 still need a bit of offset on the pins, also NTC holes not centered
- RFC1 touches LORA module
- RFC2, need bigger inductor/footprint, to handle 1A
- U200, the MT3608 has diff footprint than RT9293, use same type for both ?
- U200 control ok via 3V logic levels ? Is there feedtrough of 20V to the cpu ?
- D6, replace with SS24 maybe ?
- SS34 footrpint needs to be wider, and pads need spacing out!
- C27/C28 possible wrong placement
