# mcHF

The mcHF is a fully open source SDR transceiver intended to be used on the HF bands. 
Main goal is to provide planet-wide, off-grid communications(ionosphere allowing),
without the need of cellular or satellite infrastructure.

It could be easily built, it's firmware compiled and updated.
The hardware is designed to be modular with mostly off the shelf components that could be easily soldered by hand and easy to repair.\
Both, hardware and firmware is built by combining the great work of many hams. Please feel free to make one yourself and contribute.
