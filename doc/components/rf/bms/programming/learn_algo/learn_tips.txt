1. Configure the dataflash with appropriate parameters suitable for customer's application; 
configure pack's chemistry and perform calibration

2. Activate impedance track then ensure RDIS flag is set and discharge the pack in full (without triggering any protection!!!)

3. Relax for 5 hours and ensure both RDIS and VOK are cleared at the end of relaxation

4. Fully charge the pack; ensure VOK is set at the beginning of charge and FC flag is set at the end of charge

5. Relax for approximately 2 hours; ensure both VOK and RDIS are cleared at the end of relaxation

6. Perform full discharge of the pack; ensure VOK is set at the beginning of discharge

Notes:

	1. The charging current must drop below the Taper Current for at least 80 seconds for charge termination
